It’s the midday hour
I’m all alone in my house
Standing in my living room
I’m all alone in my house

I stare out the windows
I stare at the ocean
Suddenly afraid
I see the ocean coming closer

I want to run away
But I daren’t go outside
I don’t want to watch
But I daren’t close my eyes

I whisper “help”
Although I know 
That no one can hear me

I leave the house
I walk to the ocean
There’s nothing to hear
Nature is frozen

The trees are shrinking
The ocean drying up
And though I walk and walk
I never get any closer

I turn to look behind me
My house is full of people
Run towards the cliffs
Where the ocean’s disappearing

I scream for help
Although I know
That no one can hear me

The brain is alone.
